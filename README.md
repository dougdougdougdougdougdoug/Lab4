Lab 4

Deployment: https://dougdougdougdougdougdoug.github.io/Lab4/

This Lab uses the [OpenWeather API](openweathermap.org) to obtain weather data for the United States.

The user enters a zipcode which then concatenates itself into the API request for weather data at that particular zipcode. 
The website then uses the approrpiate image for a broad range of [weather conditions](openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).
